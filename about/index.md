I'm a data science enthusiast. My interests include deep learning, machine learning, data analysis and programming in Python.

I previously worked as Senior Researcher at [Strathclyde University, UK](https://www.strath.ac.uk/) and as an Industrial Associate at [Building Research Establishment, UK](https://www.bregroup.com/), and received a PhD in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.strath.ac.uk/research/energysystemsresearchunit/) from Strathclyde University, UK.

Software
